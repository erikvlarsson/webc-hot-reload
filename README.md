# Manual refreshing sucks.

A faster and leaner development environment for developing web components with hot reload.


### What is this? 
This environment setup consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), which enables hot reload.

- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
